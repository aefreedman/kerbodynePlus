Kerbodyne Plus is an end-game parts pack for the game Kerbal Space Program.

##Project Goals
* Provide optimized parts for large construction
* Improve end-game play
* Provide beautifully designed parts
* Conform to modular design practices (shared materials, uniform dimensions, etc)
* Combine parts to reduce part count
* Keep designs grounded in reality (or at worst near-future)
* Remain mod agnostic (Kerbodyne Plus does not support or hinder other mods)

## Special Thanks

* This mod would not exist without the work of my predecessors nil2work, Bac9, and Roverdude as well as everyone at the addon dev KSP forum. 

* I’d also like to thank all the users of Kerbodyne Plus. This is my first mod, so I’ve had to learn quite a lot as the project progressed. Thanks for being patient!
