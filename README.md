##Project Goals
* Provide optimized parts for large construction
* Improve end-game play
* Provide beautifully designed parts
* Keep designs grounded in reality (or at worst near-future)
* Remain mod agnostic (Kerbodyne Plus does not support or hinder other mods)

#Release Notes for Stable Release V1.05

* Added new part Kerbodyne ADTP-3-6 (adapter fuel tank).

#Release Notes for Stable Release V1.0

##Parts Included:

* CM1 24 Kerbal Command Pod
* S3 KL-11 "Behemoth" Liquid Booster (max thrust 8000, ISP 320/295 in vac)
* Kerbodyne K-12 Tank (13163 LF, 16088 Ox, 3.75m profile, 15m tall)

* "Leviathan" Solar Wing (simply massive solar panels)
* XL-6 Landing Strut (3.75M high)

##What's New:

* If you played with the alpha release then many of these parts will look familiar. Everything aside from the docking ports has been remodeled and everything has been retextured.
* All textures are now dds!
* Many naming conventions have been reworked in order to give a more logical relationship to the parts (T404 A-1 and T404 B-2 for example)
* Models were compiled in many instances with more than two materials, and split into separate mesh items, to further optimize memory footprint.

##Todo:

* Part rebalancing (many parts need better mass, heat, and monetary costs.
* More parts!
* Agency missions for those parts! (subject to change)
* Refine part naming conventions
* Further part memory optimizations!

## Special Thanks

* This mod would not exist without the work of my predecessors nil2work, Bac9, and Roverdude as well as everyone at the addon dev KSP forum. 

* I’d also like to thank all the users of Kerbodyne Plus. This is my first mod, so I’ve had to learn quite a lot as the project progressed. Thanks for being patient!
