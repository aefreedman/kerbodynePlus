Copy the folder “kerbodynePlus” to your GameData folder.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have KSP 1.05 or higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n# About\r\n\r\n##Summary\r\n\r\nKerbodyne Plus is an end-game parts pack for the game Kerbal Space Program.\r\n[link](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/)\r\n\r\n##Pics\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/UZEntDe.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/zXRe9xY.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ZalILxk.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kLrY8C7.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/DPt3K9c.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/c2kTfjv.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Project Goals\r\n* Provide optimized parts for large construction\r\n* Improve end-game play\r\n* Provide beautifully designed parts\r\n* Conform to modular design practices (shared materials, uniform dimensions, etc)\r\n* Combine parts to reduce part count\r\n* Keep designs grounded in reality (or at worst near-future)\r\n* Remain mod agnostic (Kerbodyne Plus does not support or hinder other mods)\r\n\r\n\r\n#Release Notes for Stable Release V1.0\r\n\r\n##Parts Included:\r\n\r\n* CM1 24 Kerbal Command Pod\r\n* S3 KL-11 \"Behemoth\" Liquid Booster (max thrust 8000, ISP 320/295 in vac)\r\n* Kerbodyne K-12 Tank (13163 LF, 16088 Ox, 3.75m profile, 15m tall)\r\n* T404 3.75M Adapter\r\n* T404 A-1, A-2, A-3 Integrated trusses\r\n* T404 B-1, B-2, B-3 Integrated trusses\r\n* T404 Side Panel\r\n* \"London\" Docking Port (1.25, 2.5, 3.75 variants)\r\n* \"Leviathan\" Solar Wing (simply massive solar panels)\r\n* XL-6 Landing Strut (3.75M high)\r\n\r\n##What's New:\r\n\r\n* If you played with the alpha release then many of these parts will look familiar. Everything aside from the docking ports has been remodeled and everything has been retextured.\r\n* All textures are now dds!\r\n* Many naming conventions have been reworked in order to give a more logical relationship to the parts (T404 A-1 and T404 B-2 for example)\r\n* Models were compiled in many instances with more than two materials, and split into separate mesh items, to further optimize memory footprint.\r\n\r\n##Todo:\r\n\r\n* Part rebalancing (many parts need better mass, heat, and monetary costs.\r\n* More parts!\r\n* Agency missions for those parts! (subject to change)\r\n* Refine part naming conventions\r\n* Further part memory optimizations!\r\n\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n\r\n## Current Team\r\n\r\n* Bonus Eventus — 3d Modeling, CFG design, Project Lead\r\n\r\n## Special Thanks\r\n\r\n* This mod would not exist without the work of my predecessors nil2work, Bac9, and Roverdude as well as everyone at the addon dev KSP forum. \r\n\r\n* I’d also like to thank all the users of Kerbodyne Plus. This is my first mod, so I’ve had to learn quite a lot as the project progressed. Thanks for being patient!\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThis work and all its files is shared under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license.
