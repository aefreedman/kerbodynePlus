// kerbodyne plus fuel tanks are assumed to be 60% of the weight of a 1m x 1m unit 
// of the total dry mass of a s3 tank multiplied by the total surface area of the fuel
// tank in question. This turns out to be 0.06 tons per meter squared.

// fuel ratio is 1:1.22 or fuel = 82% of oxidizer

// oxidizer = total of fuel + oxidizer * 0.54945055

// one unit of fuel  = 5kg

// 1kg of fuel takes up 14 L

// 14 L = 0.014m3

// volume formula for a cylinder is: volume(m3) = pi * radius(squared) * height

// area of a cylinder formula: A=2πrh+2πr(squared)
