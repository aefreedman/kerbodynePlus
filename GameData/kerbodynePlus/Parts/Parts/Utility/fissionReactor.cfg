title = A8A Fission Reactor 
manufacturer = Kerbodyne
description = The A8A Fission Reactor provides the “next level” in space flight power generation. Provided with enough coolant (Liquid Fuel) the radioactive rods in the core can generate power for decades! This small modular reactor provides a whopping 2250 electric charge per second. Sorry, radiators not included.
