	description = CM1 or Crew Module One (also called “Impunity”) is an affront to nature and all of Kerbalkind. With its modular quad-capsule design it can comfortably seat 24 Kerbals. However it still has room for more. We stuffed the left over space with our  newest AI pilot (“AutoAviator III”), ample experiment storage, 500 units of monoprop, 1000 units of electric charge, and our patented large reaction system (packing 250 units of torque)! Yep, we’re insane. Just try and stop us!
