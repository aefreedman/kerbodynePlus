	description =  The T404 B-2 XL Modular Truss is a much larger, hollow version of the T202 truss. Features a roomy interior (7.5m in diameter), incredible structural strength, and 300 units of electric charge. Good for unpressurized storage. The B series of trusses have no surface panels which makes them even lighter and a little cheaper!
