	description =  When a disgruntled group of Kerbodyne flight techs tried to hang our CEO from his ceiling fan, we knew something or someone would have to give. And this is what we gave, A 3.75M to T404 truss adapter. Now you can finally attach something round to something hugely octagonal!  Features incredible structural strength and cool looking piston things.
