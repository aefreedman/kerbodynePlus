	description =  The T404 H-2 XL Modular Truss is a much larger, hollow version of the T202 truss. Features a roomy interior (7.5m in diameter), incredible structural strength, and 100 units of electric charge. The H series of trusses have some of the side-walls removed for ease of access. Itâ€™s lighter and less expensive too!
